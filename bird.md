# preface

i've been reading murakami's memoir, which in particular contains that anecdote of his suddenly realizing he could write a novel. i remembered a few minutes ago that dream i had over the summer, where i was filled with the sensation that i had an idea for a novel. maybe i should act on that. of course, all i woke up with was a few images, most notably the bridge with the giant hand-steeple supporting it in the middle. it struck me just now though, as i was thinking about it, that another facet of the sensation was that i was looking down on everything from above, like i was flying over the east coast and then flying down / zooming in to see a boy on long island or in connecticut. which gave me the idea of a bird flying between two characters as a character-narrator. my idea for now is that the bird has a consciousness fairly disconnected from its physical form, and that this bird is part of a class of birds that fly between and connect the lives of lovers. the bird wants to gain freedom. maybe that means death / the end of the love.

imagining the two lovers for this bird are lucy and me. should see early parts of the lives before they know each other, the bird there.

giant bird conspiracy!

May 2015, bird (on the tree, looking through the window at harvard)

I have waited a long time for this. In fact, as she climbs upon him it dawns upon me that I have reached a summit, that my entire life has in some sense been clambering up towards this moment, and that I am petrified of turning and looking down the far side of the peak.

Through the window I see their lives unfolding, his lips moving and then hers. Interleaved within is the window's reflection of me, passing through them with leaves' shadows as the tree limb my feet grip bobs in the night's wind. Their lips finally join. I imagine myself abandoning my perch, dark wings beating against the dark sky, but in the reflection I see that my feet do not let go.
