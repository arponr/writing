# On art

The following was scratched in a notebook on a beach in the Bahamas in March 2014. In an act of preservation, I'm neatly typing (and minorly editing) it here now in September 2015, though as I type I find myself recoiling from or wanting to qualify and clarify some of the propositions put forth.

## Trying think about the purposes of art and science

Science tells you how to do things. Maybe engineering (in all its forms) does this more directly, but science lets you understand the universe, and understanding is teh best way to do something. Math at least partially falls into this category---it gives you a language to model concepts which arise naturally, and to formulate a framework to study pattern and concepts. Sometimes I think all these patterns and concepts are really natural, *physical* things, for some loose definition of physical. Like they exist independently of humanity, and math and science let us discover things about the physical universe.

But why is this important to do? There's an obvious answer: it's led to the "progress" and "advancement" of society, and we think it will contninue to do the same. But it seems any answer to "what's important?" is necessarily going to be completely arbitrary and subjective. In the sense that I don't think "importance" is a physical, objective concept that exists independently of us. We created it (or rather it was evolutionarily created in us) because it's a useful tool to survive. Maybe that's the only physically important thing, meaning we know instinctively that it's important to survive. But when someone asks philosophically "what's important?", we're grasping at something different and I think unphysical---inherently subjective.

This is what I think the arts are for. To go about your life in a purposeful and meaningful way (or to decide this is impossible maybe) one needs to decide: what is important? and what is right? Again, I think there's no right answer objectively. There are common heuristics---saving lives, increasing welfare of society. But I think these are just evolutionarily encoded, and moreover, they keep *order* in a society of random physical objects. This is why we think there is a morality we should follow---because its historically useful. This is why people agree Hitler was bad. What he decided was right and important doesn't conform to the heuristics. But it's subjective.

Art exposes ideas that can help us *personally* decide on what is important. This is why it needs interpretation. Academics help us expose ideas, but we personally need to decide what it means to us. The artists puts down what they think might be worth it.

Art is like trying to help you establish some *axioms* for life/morality. Science might then help you deduce from these axioms. Art seems more fundamental to your humanity, even though science studies more fundamental objects. Given how vaguely these concepts are defined, this might be part of the definition of what I consider art (and that it accomplishes it through aesthetic).

## What about beauty and interest?

I've often answered (or put foward as a good potential answer) the question "Why do you ____?" as: "Because it's interesting". And it's been my strong belief (rationalization?) that that's a perfectly good (perhaps the best) answer. I think my thoughts on this have evolved a little bit.

This began with the thoughts in the previous section. I mean, isn't the obvious purpose of art simply: beauty. In particular, art in teh strictest sense of the word, from a whil ago was paintings of flowers and scrupltures of gods or men. No abstract ideas (as far as I can tell)---just beauty and form, pure. Isn't this alone reason to create something?

The simple answer is yes. The more complete answer, I am now realizing I think, is yes, but there's something more that can be done. And I think this explains why there's a tendency historically for art to become more abstract and conceptual, be it painting or literature or music. Beauty is the most fundamental, emotional, *physical* purpose of art. (I say physical because it seems beauty is really a sort of physical, visceral sort of feeling in its tuest form. But I need to think about this further.) But there's a higher-order function which is what I about in the previous section: exposing ideas and concepts that let us think about humanity and the universe and in particular what is important.

It's interesting that this function has correlated with beauty somehow. I think it's because to get a grasp on / think about such slippery, ambiguous ideas as "what is important", people need an emotional and aesthetic medium. It's an aesthetic and visceral sort of truth that one is looking for in art and in answering these questions. So artists engage with these ideas with beauty---writers understand through metaphor, painters through shape and color, etc.---and then publish it for others to think about and interpret.

What does this have to do with "interesting"? Simply: interesting is to doing as beautiful is to making. I think they're the same.
