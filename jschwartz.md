# But I'm not through

Late Sunday morning and I are peeking at each other, from behind 97%-drawn window blinds and from beneath a 98%-pulled-up comforter, respectively. It After we're each satisfied that the other's really here, I turn onto my back, uncover twelve percent more of myself to stare at the ceiling and take inventory of things, sketch a todo list.

I come up 100% empty. Like five minutes have passed and my sketch is just a blank off-white ceiling. 


It's as gorgeous a summder day as long island gets and as my fingers tap out rhythm on the door I sort of loat up
