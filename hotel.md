# Heart Hotel

Waft up into the atmosphere with all the other in-flight scents, for some precisely prescribed but immaterial length of time, drifting and swirling and who knows what goes on at those altitudes, till the prescription runs out and you are sucked down into the world. Fall through infinity---fractals of branching passages, vague semiotics, and cordoned sinusoids---till infinity spits you out in front of Arrivals. Watch swarthy creatures slouching by towards Departures while you wait to diffuse into some vehicle which barely stops and then flows, onward, submerged in a viscous cavalcade. Surface and emerge, finally, at your destination. The night is dark red and pulsing.

Come inside, welcome. This hotel is nestled at the heart of me.

## Floor Eleven

It's October 2004, and the hallway is lined with those lurid lockers, the ones which send the average American hurtling back in fits of nostalgia toward some teenage point in spacetime. Only this is one of my not-even-teen years, and it's right here and now.

Look at me---no, not at me, at not-even-teen me---leaning like I must have seen on TV against an orange locker adjacent to her orange locker. I'm fidgeting, imperceptibly I hope, maybe even just inwardly. A pen full of red ink comes out of my pocket and into my hand and begins to fidget with me. What am I saying?

". . . ."

I capital-L Like, a.k.a. like-like, her. Who knows why. Are we even friends? Seriously, what am I saying? That capital-L has planted itself right inside me. Its roots reach far deeper than my sorry logic could ever dig.

". . . ."

My neck squirms, eyes wander, searching for some wit or charm or something, but something else finds me: the pen explodes. The idiomatic explosion is more metaphoric than literal though, the spray of ink scrawny and pathetic, yet in perfectly catastrophic trajectory, existing in all the wrong places and moments.

I am too young for innuendo to apply. This is real.

Dear god, I am bleeding all over her and her baby-blue North Face fleece. So many dreams shatter around me as my glossy oxygenated red struggles to harmonize with her soft baby-blue, like some grotesque hall of inconsistently colored mirrors. My neck snaps into place, eyes freeze, and, as neck- and eye-mobility appear to be gradually transferred over to her, she slowly lifts her heavy gaze from her orange locker. The gaze, expressing and therefore evoking terror,
thuds down onto me. I need to react. I Like her so much I'm bleeding. I need a reaction.

I laugh. I double over, laughing.

Her terror metamorphoses in between eye-blinks: into anger, then sadness, then disgust. All those feelings I decide between mirroring eye-blinks I had always wanted from her, my muddled feelings finally clearing up and rising into consciousness. Yes, of course: I hate her with all my heart.

". . . ."

Does she say something? A ventricle is pounding at my ear, and I am far too busy with my laughter. A bell interposes to notify us the day is over, cackling along with me as my brand new nemesis storms off into the afternoon.
