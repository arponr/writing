Waft up into the atmosphere with all the other in-flight scents,
for some precisely prescribed but immaterial length of time,
drifting and swirling and who knows what
goes on at those altitudes, till the prescription runs out and

you are sucked down into the world. Fall through infinity---
fractals of branching passages, vague semiotics, and cordoned sinusoids---
till infinity spits you out in front of Arrivals.
Watch swarthy creatures slouch by towards Departures
while you wait to diffuse into some
vehicle which barely stops and then flows,
onward, submerged in a viscous cavalcade.
Surface and emerge, finally, at your destination.

The night is dark red and pulsing.
Come inside, welcome. This hotel is nestled at the heart of me.
