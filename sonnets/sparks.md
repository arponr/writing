It was when I emptied myself,
of mathematics, of irony, of myself,
that I walked to a well-worn bench,
sat, and wondered at

the sparks of sunlight, reflected
brilliantly in angles,
just for moments, in the modest peaks
of the Charles; and wondered,

do they see the other sparks,
the life they breathe
together, into the water,
in those moments,
before they return
to the sky and sun?
