As she climbs upon him it dawns upon me
that I have been obtained by a summit---an instant of structure
composed & being composed of calipers and calendars
of substructure beneath & within me---and that
I am petrified of the volta, of the imminent side of the peak.

Through the window I observe their lips & lives unfolding,
and the window's reflection of me interleaved
with leaves' shadows, rippling through them
as the tree limb my feet grip bobs in the night's wind.
Their lips finally join

the susurrus of history. Will you remember this forever?
I imagine myself abandoning my perch,
midnight wings beating against the midnight sky,
but the reflection does not alight, the mountain does not recede.
