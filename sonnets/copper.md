When, exactly, did ivy begin crawling
up my distinguished stone skin? When, exactly,
did I decide my skin was best cloaked
in stone-grey? I swear that my skin once shined

like fresh copper, glinted in the pool under summer sun
at my Greek friend George's house in 2002, at a party thrown
because he was moving away, to Georgia, funnily,
and sadly, though I didn't know so then.

On Princeton's campus is a copper statue
coated in the verdigris of historicity.
But look at the plate on the plinth: the figure
was established in 1993, the patina painted,

to be washed away in drops of sincerity. A statue
of reversed temporality, to one day come alive.
