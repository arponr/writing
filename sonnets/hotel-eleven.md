Hurtle back to that hallway lined with lurid lockers,
when you Liked her, like-liked her, that capital "L" planted outside
of time, roots far deeper than sorry logic could ever dig.
The neck squirms, the eyes wander, the red pen twirls

and then explodes, idiomatically more than literally but no less
devastatingly, a scrawny spray with catastrophic trajectory.
Innocence precludes innuendo; this is real.

Dear god, you are bleeding all over her baby-blue North Face.
The neck snaps, the eyes freeze, mobility transferred to her
iridium gaze, expressing and therefore evoking terror as it thuds down onto

You need to react. You, who Like her so much you're bleeding, need a reaction.
You, of course, laugh; double over, laughing. Watch her
terror metamorphose in between eye-blinks: red, blue, black.
Decide, between mirroring eye-blinks: yes, of course, you hate her with all your heart.
